# Information and Communication Technologies
**Instructor: Joerg Blumtritt**  

From the earliest traces of art to technologies existing only as speculative design, this course will explore the development, reaction, and impact of developments and inventions in communication. Did techniques like painting, music, or writing, and "inventions" like the printing, the telegraph or television shape people's lives, or have they been formed by the existing cultures? How do forces of economics and culture promote or inhibit inventing, accessing, and profiting from technology? Can we envision technologies beyond the norms defined by the factual conditions of our present?

This course will focus on the role and application of communication technologies with a transnational cross-cultural lens. Beginning in ancient times and making our way to the present, we will analyze how, why, and to what effect innovations were adopted both geographically and culturally and deconstruct how this history is told to us. Readings and discussion will cover history and historiography, the philosophy of technology, science and technology studies, media theory, and creative application. Weekly writing assignments will traverse a variety of media forms and contexts.

## Learning Outcomes
### Course learning outcomes
(reference to programme learning outcomes in brackets (PLO)

1. (PLO 4): Think critically and work creatively toward innovations in communication technology, design, and computation.
2. (PLO 1): Demonstrate an understanding of the historical significance of major technical inventions situated in the field of communications.
3. (PLO 3): Describe key concepts and theories that explain the relationship between these innovations and the development of human behavior, incorporating global, cultural, social, and political perspectives.

5. (PLO 6): Gain exposure to writing across various forms of media, old and new.
6. (PLO 7): Clearly communicate ideas and analysis in a verbal, visual, auditory, experiential, and written form.

### Programme Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of the major in Interactive Media at NYU Abu Dhabi, all students are expected to have fulfilled the following:
1. Research and Understanding: IM students will cultivate a substantive understanding of the past, present, and future landscape of Interactive Media.
2. Analytical Thinking: IM students will be challenged to answer fundamental questions relating to the field of Interactive Media.
3. Conceptual Thinking: IM students will develop conceptual skills through the use of computational and interactive media tools to create project-based work and project oriented research.
4. Critical Thinking: IM students will refine their critical thinking skills by analysing and critiquing work in cultural, social, historical, ethical, and aesthetic contexts.
5. Technical Implementation: IM students will cultivate technical skills with contemporary media technologies to execute their coursework.
6. Creative Processes: IM students will gain the ability to explore, innovate, and realise creative ideas in multiple fields of inquiry and interest.
7. Organisation and Communication: IM students will develop professional practices of delivering and sharing their work.
8. Collaboration: IM Students will gain experience in collaboration through active participation in group and team-based work.
## Assignments
- Reading and watching the provided material is required in advance for each class.
- Assigned readings and videos will be discussed in class. Preparedness (i.e. having read/watched the assigned material), active participation, and therefore attendance to the classes will be graded.
- The readings, writing assignments, as well assigned talks and presentations can be found on NYU Classes, as well as in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bu35X0wV_cASv74YWs31mLPuC5KtvBMBXeJX49akmqU/edit?usp=sharing
- Please submit assignments via NYU Classes. Submissions can be just links to your blog, webpage or Google document. If you have to submit via email, please put [CommTech] in front of the email subject. 

### Group Lesson
- There will be four or five student-lead lectures on an assigned topic.
- Students prepare these as full length lectures, working together in groups of 3 to 5.
- Each student is expected to work in at least one of these projects.
- The lecture can be prerecorded.
- Slides and other material has to be submitted and made available to the class.

### Analysis Paper
In a 4-5 page paper (min 1200, max 1500 words) identify a specific communication technology that was developed or emerged in your hometown, city, or country of origin. Your paper must identify and argue for factors (i.e. social, cultural, technical, political, economic or others) that caused, related, and resulted from its emergence. Also, attempt to analyze its impact and significance within the world stage of communication technology.

### Final Project - Speculative Design - The Future of Communication Technology.
Develop a narrative around an existing or imagined use of communication technology in the form of a new product or service. Your narrative should be character driven. How does communication technology impact this characterâ€™s life? Their relations with other beings and the environment? How are politics affected? Social and cultural customs? Show the world this character exists in and how it is different from today. Demonstrate the interplay of technology and society. The narrative can be written, visual (i.e. graphic novel), video or sound.

### Short Responses
- Students will write a one page response.
- All responses must be submitted on time before the next class.

## Grades and Rubrics
### Grades
10% Participation: Active contribution to the discussions, showing initiative, taking on tasks outside the assignments - this includes participation in forum discussions.
30% Assignments: Preparedness (having actually read/watched the material), timely submission of assignments, quality of work (see rubrics), presenting in class.
30% - Analysis paper
30% - Final project

### Rubrics
20% Comprehension (understanding of the material, structure, argumentation)
30% Criticism (assessing the form, intention, preliminary conditions of the assigned material; questioning the arguments), resp. technical complexity for programming assignments
50% Creativity (Showing original thoughts and ideas; compelling form of presentation; creative use of various techniques with focus on interactive media; aesthetics of the experience)

### Assignments will be graded according to the following scale of 100%
- Poor	Evinced poor absorption of material, or made no effort (0-70%)
- Adequate	Accomplished enough to prove the student encountered the material (71-80%)
- Good	Demonstrated strong effort incorporating and articulating concepts in a creative way (81-90%)
- Excellent	Exceptional creativity, understanding and synthesis of the material (91-100%)

### Attendance and Participation
- Engaging in the class discussion, offering feedback to peers, and being mentally present is a major part of the grade, no matter if in real time or in virtual discussions.

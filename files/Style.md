# Guide for Submitting Work

## Text
All text can generally be submitted directly via Canvas. 

### Header, Title, Author
Format your text always starting with a header. 
- The header should always include the name of the course and information on the assignment (e.g. the general topic covered in the week of the assignment). This information is the *pre title*.
- Next comes the title of the text. The title is a one-line summary of what the text is about. The title is not the text of the assignment. The title is specific to your text.
- Next comes your name. Always include your name, otherwise it might be lost by whom the text was written.

### Abstract
The first paragraph of your text should be an abstract. The abstract summarizes the question and thesis of the text. It should be sufficient to read the abstract to understand what the text is about.

### The Body
The body of the text outlines your thoughts in detail. It should be structured into logical paragraphs of 5 to 12 lines. 

### Citations
You can always use external sources. Using other people's ideas is never plagiarism as long as you properly credit whatever source you use.
- Format your citations following the Chicago Manual of style https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html
- You can use either the "Notes and Bibliography" or the "Auther Date" styles.
- If you can't find a proper citation for your source, add a footnote and describe how you found your material (e.g. "I remember having read an article ... but can't find it online", etc.)

## Slides, Presentations
### Title Slide
Always include a title slide with the following information:
- Authorâ€“i.e. your name
- Assignment, e.g. the general topic covered in the week of the assignment
- Title; this is the title of your specific presentation, not the general title of the assignment

### Citations

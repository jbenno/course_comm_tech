# Art and communication technology
[Video recording of this lecture](https://stream.nyu.edu/media/Communication+%26+Technology+10/1_2rru6z06)
Note: Unfortunately one work of art contains music by the Dutch composer Henk Badings. The Copyright owner Orchard Music has demanded that I take out the audio part of that clip. 

That we cannot even have a fair use of music that was composed 70 years ago for educational purposes is a strong demonstration of the crookedness of the regime of intellectual property. On the other hand: The music was not that great anyway. It may rightfully be forgotten :)

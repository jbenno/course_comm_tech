# Use of generative AI
Learning only happens as a result of effort on your part. You should not use these tools to replace the effort required for you to learn. Tools like ChatGPT or Gemini can help you generate ideas, practice for tests, and save time on repetitive tasks. They can also be a shortcut that limits what you get out of this class. 

You may use GenAI tools for generating ideas you modify or alternative options to choose from, but you should be thoughtful about selecting and editing the options.

Like with other sources, you are expected to acknowledge that use. Cite the tools you used, how you used them, and in what part of your process. 

You remain responsible for all aspects of your work. In any use of AI-generated material, you are responsible for its accuracy, and will be graded down for not catching errors the tool generates. You are also responsible for understanding the material in your assignments and expected to elaborate on any work you hand in.

Remember that these tools have the same ethical weaknesses, especially with regards to race and gender, exhibited on the broader internet.
